/**
 * The ImageReader class allows direct access to ImageBuffers generated from a video source of the
 * native platform. The video source could be a Surface on the android platform or an
 * HTMLVideoElement on the web platform. You should call ImageReader::acquireNextBuffer() to read a
 * new ImageBuffer each time when the video source is changed. All ImageBuffers generated from one
 * ImageReader share the same internal texture, which allows you to continuously read the latest
 * content from the video source with minimal memory copying. However, there are two limits:
 *
 *    1) The generated ImageBuffers are bound to the associated GPU Context when first being drawn
 *       and cannot be drawn to another Context anymore.
 *    2) The generated ImageBuffers may have a limited lifetime and cannot create textures after
 *       expiration. Usually, the previously acquired ImageBuffer will expire after the newly
 *       created ImageBuffer is drawn. So there are only two ImageBuffers that can be accessed
 *       simultaneously.
