# /cr — Code Review

Automated code review for local branches, PRs, commits, and files. Detects
review mode from arguments and routes to the appropriate review flow — either
quick single-agent review with interactive fix selection, or multi-agent
deep review with risk-based auto-fix.

All user-facing text matches the user's language. All questions and option
selections MUST use your interactive dialog tool (e.g. AskUserQuestion) — never
output options as plain text. Do not proceed until the user replies.

## Route

Run pre-checks, then match the **first** applicable rule top-to-bottom:

1. `git branch --show-current` → record whether on main/master.
2. `git status --porcelain` → record whether uncommitted changes exist.
3. Check whether the current environment supports agent teams (multiple agents
   working in parallel and communicating with each other).

| # | Condition | Action |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | `$ARGUMENTS` is a PR number or URL containing `/pull/` | → `references/pr-review.md` |
| 2 | Agent teams NOT supported | → `references/local-review.md` |
| 3 | Uncommitted changes exist | → `references/local-review.md` |
| 4 | On main/master branch | → `references/local-review.md` |
| 5 | Everything else | → Question below |

Each `→` means: `Read` the target file and follow it as the sole remaining
instruction. Ignore all sections below. Do NOT review from memory or habit —
each target file defines specific constraints on how to obtain diffs, apply
fixes, and submit results.

## Question (rule 2 only)

Ask a **single question** with this exact title:
"Agent Teams is available (multiple agents working in parallel). Enable multi-agent review with reviewer–verifier adversarial mechanism and auto-fix?"
Provide 4 options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Single-agent + manual fix | Single-agent review; interactively choose which issues to fix afterward. |
| Teams + auto-fix low risk | Multi-agent review; auto-fix only the safest issues (e.g., null checks, typos, naming). Confirm everything else. |
| Teams + auto-fix low & medium risk (recommended) | Multi-agent review; auto-fix most issues, only confirm high-risk ones (e.g., API changes, architecture). |
| Teams + auto-fix all | Multi-agent review; auto-fix everything. Only issues affecting test baselines are deferred. |

### Hand off

| Option | → | FIX_MODE |
|--------|---|----------|
| Single-agent + manual fix | `references/local-review.md` | — |
| Teams + auto-fix low risk | `references/teams-review.md` | low |
| Teams + auto-fix low & medium risk (recommended) | `references/teams-review.md` | low_medium |
| Teams + auto-fix all | `references/teams-review.md` | full |

Pass `$ARGUMENTS` to the target file. For teams-review, also pass `FIX_MODE`
(low / low_medium / full).
