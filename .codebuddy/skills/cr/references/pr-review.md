# PR Review

PR review uses **Worktree mode** — fetch the PR branch locally so review can
read related code across modules, at the exact version of the PR branch. This
is critical for review accuracy.

## Step 1: Create worktree

If `$ARGUMENTS` is a URL, extract the PR number from it.

Clean up leftover worktrees from previous sessions:
```bash
for dir in /tmp/pr-review-*; do
    [ -d "$dir" ] || continue
    n=$(basename "$dir" | sed 's/pr-review-//')
    git worktree remove "$dir" 2>/dev/null
    git branch -D "pr-${n}" 2>/dev/null
done
```

Validate PR target:
```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner
gh pr view {number} --json headRefName,baseRefName,headRefOid,state,body
```
Record `OWNER_REPO`. Extract: `PR_BRANCH`, `BASE_BRANCH`, `HEAD_SHA`, `STATE`,
`PR_BODY`.
If either command fails, inform the user and abort.
If `$ARGUMENTS` is a URL containing `{owner}/{repo}`, verify it matches
`OWNER_REPO`. If not, inform the user that cross-repo PR review is not
supported and abort.
If `STATE` is not `OPEN`, inform the user and exit.

**If current branch equals `PR_BRANCH` and HEAD equals `HEAD_SHA`**, skip
worktree creation — the code is already local.

**Otherwise**, create a worktree:
```bash
git fetch origin pull/{number}/head:pr-{number}
git worktree add --no-track /tmp/pr-review-{number} pr-{number}
cd /tmp/pr-review-{number}
```
If worktree creation fails, inform the user and abort.

---

## Step 2: Collect diff and context

```bash
git fetch origin {BASE_BRANCH}
git merge-base origin/{BASE_BRANCH} HEAD
git diff <merge-base-sha>
```
If the diff exceeds 200 lines, first run `git diff --stat` to get an overview,
then read the diff per file using `git diff -- {file}` to avoid output
truncation.

If diff is empty → clean up worktree and exit.

Fetch existing PR review comments for de-duplication:
```bash
gh api repos/{OWNER_REPO}/pulls/{number}/comments
```

---

## Step 3: Review

**Internal analysis**:

1. Based on the diff, read relevant code context as needed to understand the
   change's correctness (e.g., surrounding logic, base classes, callers).
2. Read `PR_BODY` to understand the stated motivation. Verify the
   implementation actually achieves what the author describes.
3. Apply `code-checklist.md` to code files, `doc-checklist.md` to
   documentation files. Use `judgment-matrix.md` to decide whether each issue
   is worth reporting.
4. Check whether issues raised in previous PR comments have been fixed.
5. For each potential issue, perform a second-pass verification: re-read the
   surrounding code and check — is there a guard or early return elsewhere
   that handles this? Does the call chain guarantee preconditions? Am I
   misunderstanding lifetime or ownership?
6. **Discard all ruled-out issues. Keep only issues confirmed to exist.**
7. De-duplicate confirmed issues against existing PR comments.

**Output rule**: only present the final confirmed issues to the user. Do not
output analysis process, exclusion reasoning, or issues that were considered
but ruled out.

## Step 4: Clean up and report

If a worktree was created, clean it up:
```bash
cd -
git worktree remove /tmp/pr-review-{number}
git branch -D pr-{number}
```

Present results to user:
- Summary: one paragraph describing the purpose and scope of the change.
- Overall assessment: code quality evaluation and key improvement directions.
- Issue list (or "no issues found" if clean).

If no issues → ask whether to submit an approval review AND merge the PR:

1. Submit Approval:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{OWNER_REPO}/pulls/{number}/reviews --input - <<'EOF'
   {
     "commit_id": "{HEAD_SHA}",
     "event": "APPROVE"
   }
   EOF
   ```

2. Merge (squash):
   ```bash
   gh pr merge {number} --squash --delete-branch
   ```

If the user declines, do nothing. Skip the comment submission below.

If issues found → present confirmed issues to user in the following format:

```
{N}. [{priority}] {file}:{line} — {description of the problem and suggested fix}
```

Where `{priority}` is the checklist item ID (e.g., A2, B1, C7). Then ask the
user to select which issues to submit using **a single multi-select question**
where each option's label is the issue summary (e.g.,
`[A2] file:line — description`). User checks multiple options in one prompt.
Unchecked issues are skipped.

**Must** use `gh api` + heredoc. Do not use `gh pr comment`, `gh pr review`,
or any command that creates non-line-level comments:

```bash
gh api repos/{OWNER_REPO}/pulls/{number}/reviews --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "commit_id": "{HEAD_SHA}",
  "event": "COMMENT",
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "relative/file/path",
      "line": 42,
      "side": "RIGHT",
      "body": "Description of the issue and suggested fix"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

- `commit_id`: HEAD SHA of the PR branch
- `path`: relative to repository root
- `line`: line number in the **new** file (right side of diff). Must be
  determined during Step 3 by reading the actual file in the worktree — do
  not derive from diff hunk offsets.
- `side`: always `"RIGHT"`
- `body`: concise, in the user's conversation language, with a specific fix
  suggestion when possible

Summary of issues found / submitted / skipped.
